\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}
General Usage of SRNs 
  reduce data, slightly decrease performance
  interpolation between frames (superresolution)
=> useful for vector fields
requirements of flow fields:
  preserve not just individual points but the main defining stream features
  *cit Streamlines encapsulate the information to reconstruct a flow field
Specific goal of the thesis:
  prior implementation of SRN exists:
  => good results already (lower data usage, decent quality)
  evaluate prior results on streamlines using l2, bof
  train a network on streamlines and see how it goes
