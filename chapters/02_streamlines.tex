\chapter{Streamline Integration}\label{chapter:streamlines}
streamline vs streakline vs pathline
what is used in the following (eval vs network)
\section{General Methodology}
Seed initial points:
Generate next set of points
repeat
result is Tensor of Shape x
\section{Seeding Strategy}
different strategies to capture more "interesting" parts of the field
good coverage
\subsection{Uniform Random}
even coverage
can have many points in less "interesting" regions
\subsection{Uniform Deterministic}
guaranteed very even coverage even with few points
good for testing
\subsection{Importance Sampling using local Entropy}
How is Entropy calculated here?:
  Sphere of equal regions
  neighborhood size
  Use vector length or not?
Rejection Sampling
  intensity
  min probability
uneven coverage, focus on "important" regions
\subsection{Comparison}
On Speed and Accuracy

\section{Integration Methods}

\subsection{Euler-Integration}
procedure
no additional samples needed
\subsection{Runge-Kutta}
some additional samples
error is O()
\subsection{Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg}
adaptive stepsize
more accurate
requires higher number of samples
individual?
similarity might suffer under adaptive stepsize
\chapter{Streamline Similarity}
\section{Prior Considerations}
Masking, Time-relation (streamline vs pathline), adaptive stepsize
\section{L2-Distance}
Procedure, Limitations (stepsize, length, mask)
decent since comparing streamlines with same start location
\section{Bag-Of-Features}
instead of distance generate a set of features for each point on the streamline
compare these using clustered representative feature vectors
\subsection{Choice of Features}

\subsection{Spatially Sensitive Bag-of-Features}
\section{Comparison}
On Speed and Accuracy
(Look up Error estimation)
